Bookmate is a comprehensive book management service that empowers users to discover, engage with, and discuss their favorite literary works.

Key Features:
1. User Interaction: Users can engage with books by adding comments and add books to favorites. These interactions create a vibrant community where users can share their thoughts and insights about the books they've read.
2. Administrative control: Bookmate incorporates rolebased access control, granting special privileges (such as adding, updating and deleting book, moderating comments) to users with an "admin" role.
3. Personalized Recommendations: Leveraging the favorites list, Bookmate employs a recommendation engine to offer users personalized book suggestions based on their reading preferences and interests.
